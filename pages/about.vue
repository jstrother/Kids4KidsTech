      During the Coronavirus epidemic and the transition to virtual learning, the boys experienced
      firsthand how vital technology was to their education.

      When the boys visited their mother, Jennifer’s, interior design showroom in the South Seattle
      neighborhood of Georgetown, they were struck by the stark juxtaposition of the luxury inside
      the warehouse verus the view of the street: up and down both sides, they observed wooden
      boards, tarps, and tents of people experiencing homelessness and saw young people among the
      group gathered outside.

    <p>The brothers were deeply troubled by the situation, and wanted to do something to help.</p>
    <p>
      Jack commented “It seemed as if there was a huge issue {of inaccessibility of technology among
      those living in poverty} that was being overlooked and needed to be addressed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Together, the three boys were inspired to take action, raising money to support remote
      learning for those students unable to access reliable technological resources.
    </p>
    <p>Reid said, “it will feel good to truly make a difference in the community.”</p>
    <p>
      Jack and Reid and Bayrd studied the homeless crisis in Seattle and learned that, according to
      the Point-in-Time Count for Seattle/King County, there were 11,751 individuals experiencing
      homelessness in January 2020. This number reflects a 5% increase from the previous year’s
      count.

    <h4>HOW TECHNOLOGY CAN HELP</h4>
    <p>
      While some may think of technology as a luxury for people who cannot afford to buy food, in
      fact, access to technology is critical to their ability to find resources and improve their
      situation. Access to the internet can empower individuals with access to information,
      healthcare, food and community. Now, it is especially important for students who are trying to
      go to school remotely and don’t want to fall behind in school.
